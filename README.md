# Lone Arranger plugin

Creates a Lone Arranger group that is (automatically) added to new
and existing repositories created in ArchivesSpace.

On startup:

- The Lone Arranger group permissions are reset (enforced)
- Repository users are assigned exclusively to the Lone Arranger group

The group permissions are defined here:

- TODO: LINK!
